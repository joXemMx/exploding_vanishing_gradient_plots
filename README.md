# Scripts for visualization of exploding and vanishing gradients
Part of the appendix of the master's thesis from Jonas Emmert. Inspired by https://youtu.be/87kLfzmYBy8?si=dhAgC-6mKGZenefM.

Scripts for visualization are provided for linear activation, tanh activation as well as activation with recitfied linear units (ReLU).

Hidden state initialization can be changed with `hs`. Gradients are initialized by `dh`.
